# libpd_experiments

first experiments with libpd, gpl v3


**pygame_meow** - first experimetns with libpd python bindings + pygame. .py file mostly mashed together from stack overflow and the libpd included examples. misshapen cat sprites by me. crashes sometimes atm (prob from clicking too often, should rethink states)
